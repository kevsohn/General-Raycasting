# General-Raycasting

The purpose of this project was to be able to visualize gravitational lensing with ray casting. However, the merge was unsuccessful, so the code for 2D ray casting can be found in the main branch, and the gravitational lensing can be found in clement's branch.

Use the mouse to drag the light source around the left canvas. The max angle of the beam can be increased or decreased with the 'w' and 's' keys. The beam can be rotated with the 'a' and 'd' keys to aim the light in different directions. The line density of the beam can be adjusted with the third slider on the right. Increasing the beam density will increase the resolution of the 3D rending that is seen on the right canvas.

The two other sliders was made to adjust the size and mass of the massive object that would cause the gravitational lensing. The color of the ball will change to correspond with the changing of the mass.
